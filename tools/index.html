		<h1>Tools</h1>

		<ul>
			<li><a href="/irithyll/">Irithyll ðŸ©¸</a></li>
			<p>Canvas-based 2D geometrical pattern visualization</p>

			<li><a href="simulation/">Simulation</a></li>
			<p>This is a basic evolutionary simulation that I made for my
			summative English assignment. The logical model of the psychologies
			of the protozoa is too simple to create any particularly interesting
			patterns, but the different species colours at least make it
			sometimes look kind of visually appealing.</p>

			<li><a href="asciimath/">AsciiMath but with newlines</a></li>
			<p>AsciiMath is a really convenient alternative to LaTeX for most
			of my use cases, but its live demo doesn't support line breaks. This
			is an alternative UI which solves my issue.</p>

			<li><a href="epoch/">Unix/Epoch time conversions</a></li>
			<p>This lets you convert between Unix time and normal time. It would
			have been better as a
			<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njBvWJkZcPo">CLI</a>, but I
			felt like implementing it in JavaScript for some reason.</p>

			<li>
				<a href="wc/">Word Counter</a>
				| <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ldnJmO8D4">Development</a>
			</li>
			<p>This lets you count the number of words and characters in a block of text
			that you paste in. Again, it would make much more sense as a CLI (use
			<code>wc</code>) - I made this primarily for people on Windows and as
			TypeScript practice.</p>

			<li><a href="matrix_trans/">Matrix Transformations</a></li>
			<p>This is a calculator for finding new values of 2D coordinates
			based on a 2x2 linear transformation matrix.</>
